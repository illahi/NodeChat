NodeJS Chat Server + Client 
===========
Just a very basic project I am working on to learn NodeJS (with the help of some very helpful tutorials online). Will update as I go along on this journey. Currently only basic chat functions work and timestamps.

Using:
>nodejs
>socket.io
>expressjs
>ejs
>less

Instructions:
You must have node and the libraries stated above installed on your computer. Note: I only tested this on a linux machine.

1. In terminal, when in the directory, enter: node app.js
2. In browser go to: http://localhost:3000
